MSE 201_301 Textbook

## Bugs

~~By winter quarter

	* Fix siunitx package in MathJax
		- Mathmode and units
		- not urgent

	* Printing two reference sections
		- not urgent

	* “box” questions/sections with different background
		- demo
		- box around a group of questions

	* Include Student Guide within the Solution itself
		- This is to help with student experience
		- Maybe color the responses a la the PDF
		- demo
		- In LaTeX there would be a new environment called 		student guide, then make all environments blue 

	* How can questions be grouped together?
		- The question numbering suggests there are different things --> Q.1.6 should be Q 1.1.2

## Enhancements

	* Modelling and interactive media
		- working great
		- frame is small, but jon can fix it
		- 9/10 working

	* Collecting student answers

		- Currently putting exercises in Canvas with the book embedded
		- Edfinity could work, maybe
		- Currently linking to a canvas assignment and students upload a PDF
		- The optimal solution would be to avoid chasing down documents from multiple platforms
		- Students need to sketch things to scan and turn into a PDF
		- Needs to be flexible
		- Jacob -- can someone take an OER text and get support for integrating it for teaching

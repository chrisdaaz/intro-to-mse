  abstract = {A variety of next-generation energy processes utilize the electrochemical interconversions of dioxygen and water as the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Reported here are the first estimates of the standard reduction potential of the O2 + 4e- + 4H+ {$\leftrightharpoons$} 2H2O couple in organic solvents. The values are +1.21 V in acetonitrile (MeCN) and +0.60 V in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), each versus the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple (Fc+/0) in the respective solvent (as are all of the potentials reported here). The potentials have been determined using a thermochemical cycle that combines the free energy for transferring water from aqueous solution to organic solvent, -0.43 kcal mol-1 for MeCN and -1.47 kcal mol-1 for DMF, and the potential of the H+/H2 couple, - 0.028 V in MeCN and -0.662 V in DMF. The H+/H2 couple in DMF has been directly measured electrochemically using the previously reported procedure for the MeCN value. The thermochemical approach used for the O2/H2O couple has been extended to the CO2/CO and CO2/CH4 couples to give values of -0.12 and +0.15 V in MeCN and -0.73 and -0.48 V in DMF, respectively. Extensions to other reduction potentials are discussed. Additionally, the free energy for transfer of protons from water to organic solvent is estimated as +14 kcal mol-1 for acetonitrile and +0.6 kcal mol-1 for DMF.},

A temperature of 298.15 K (25.00 \textdegree{}C; 77.00 \textdegree{}F).
An effective concentration of 1 mol/L for each aqueous species or a species in a mercury amalgam (an alloy of mercury with another metal).
A partial pressure of 101.325 kPa (absolute) (1 atm, 1.01325 bar) for each gaseous reagent. This pressure is used because most literature data are still given for this value (1 atm) rather than for the current standard of 100 kPa.
An activity of unity for each pure solid, pure liquid, or for water (solvent). The relation in electrode potential of metals in saltwater (as electrolyte) is given in the galvanic series.
Although many of the half cells are written for multiple-electron transfers, the tabulated potentials are for a single-electron transfer. All of the reactions should be divided by the stoichiometric coefficient for the electron to get the corresponding corrected reaction equation.

  abstract = {Gallium (Ga), a group III metal, is of fundamental interest due to its polymorphism and unusual phase transition behaviours. New solid phases have been observed when Ga is confined at the nanoscale. Herein, we demonstrate the stable coexistence, from 180 K to 800 K, of the unexpected solid {$\gamma$}-phase core and a liquid shell in substrate-supported Ga nanoparticles. We show that the support plays a fundamental role in determining Ga nanoparticle phases, with the driving forces for the nucleation of the {$\gamma$}-phase being the Laplace pressure in the nanoparticles and the epitaxial relationship of this phase to the substrate. We exploit the change in the amplitude of the evolving surface plasmon resonance of Ga nanoparticle ensembles during synthesis to reveal in real time the solid core formation in the liquid Ga nanoparticle. Finally, we provide a general framework for understanding how nanoscale confinement, interfacial and surface energies, and crystalline relationships to the substrate enable and stabilize the coexistence of unexpected phases.},

  title = {Bohr Model},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In atomic physics, the Rutherford\textendash{}Bohr model or Bohr model, introduced by Niels Bohr in 1913, depicts the atom as a small, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons that travel in circular orbits around the nucleus\textemdash{}similar in structure to the solar system, but with attraction provided by electrostatic forces rather than gravity. After the cubic model (1902), the plum-pudding model (1904), the Saturnian model (1904), and the Rutherford model (1911) came the Rutherford\textendash{}Bohr model or just Bohr model for short (1913). The improvement to the Rutherford model is mostly a quantum physical interpretation of it. The Bohr model has been superseded, but the quantum theory remains sound.
The model's key success lay in explaining the Rydberg formula for the spectral emission lines of atomic hydrogen. While the Rydberg formula had been known experimentally, it did not gain a theoretical underpinning until the Bohr model was introduced. Not only did the Bohr model explain the reason for the structure of the Rydberg formula, it also provided a justification for its empirical results in terms of fundamental physical constants.
The Bohr model is a relatively primitive model of the hydrogen atom, compared to the valence shell atom. As a theory, it can be derived as a first-order approximation of the hydrogen atom using the broader and much more accurate quantum mechanics and thus may be considered to be an obsolete scientific theory. However, because of its simplicity, and its correct results for selected systems (see below for application), the Bohr model is still commonly taught to introduce students to quantum mechanics or energy level diagrams before moving on to the more accurate, but more complex, valence shell atom. A related model was originally proposed by Arthur Erich Haas in 1910, but was rejected. The quantum theory of the period between Planck's discovery of the quantum (1900) and the advent of a full-blown quantum mechanics (1925) is often referred to as the old quantum theory.},

  abstract = {A model acrylic copolymer system was used to study the processes involved in the transfer of a thin viscoelastic film from a weakly adhesive elastomeric substrate to a more strongly adhesive surface. The film consisted of a layer of acrylic diblock copolymer micelles that was spun-cast onto a silicone elastomer from a suspension in butanol. A circular portion of the layer was transferred to a hemispherical glass indenter with which it was brought into contact. Transfer of the film during tensile loading of the indenter began with nucleation of a cavity at the film/elastomer interface, and was followed by delamination of the film at this interface. Statistical variations in cavity nucleation for identical loading conditions were quantified by defining a Weibull modulus similar to that used to describe the failure of brittle materials. The average energy release rate required for cavity nucleation at a fixed induction time increased with film thickness in a way that is consistent with the existence of a critical value of the hydrostatic tension at the film/substrate interface. This critical hydrostatic tension was comparable in magnitude to the elastic modulus of the substrate, and was about ten times the elastic modulus of the thin film.},

  title = {Micromechanics of Crack Growth into a Craze in a Polymer Glass},
  volume = {25},
  abstract = {The problem of craze failure near the tip of a crack embedded inside a craze is investigated in this work. Our micromechanics model is based on the presence of cross-tie fibrils in the craze microstructure. These cross-tie fibrils give the craze some small lateral load-bearing capacity so that they can transfer stress between the main fibrils. This load-transfer mechanism allows the normal stress on the fibrils directly ahead of the crack tip in the center of the craze to reach the breaking stress of the chains. An exact solution is obtained for the deformation field near the crack tip, and this solution is used to relate craze failure to the external loading and microstructural quantities such as the draw stress, the fibril spacing, and the chain breaking force. The relationship between energy flow to the crack tip due to external loading and the work of local fracture by fibril breakdown is also obtained. Our analysis shows that the normal stress sigma n acting on the fibrils at the crack tip increases linearly as the square root of the craze thickness assuming that the normal stress distribution is uniform and is equal to the drawing stress acting on the craze-bulk interface. However, our result shows that sigma n is very sensitive to the stress distribution at the craze-bulk interface so that the assumption of a constant draw stress acting on the craze-bulk interface ahead of the crack tip may underestimate sigma n. We also derived an approximate expression which relates the shear and tensile modulus of the crazed material to the underlying microstructural variables such as fibril spacing and fibril diameter.

Sources of shielding are briefly described in terms of mechanisms relying on the production of elastically constrained zones which envelop the crack (zone shielding), on the generation of wedging, bridging or sliding forces between the crack surfaces (contact shielding) and on crack path deflection and meandering. Examples are taken from the fatigue behavior of high strength lithium-containing aluminum alloys, aluminum alloy-aramid fiber-epoxy laminate composites, and zirconia ceramics. It is shown that, whereas crack tip shielding can provide a potent means of enhancing ``resistance'' to crack growth, such extrinsic toughening mechanisms can result in the apparently anomalous behavior of ``small cracks'' and to the susceptibility of brittle materials to fatigue failure.},

  abstract = {Fracking or Not Fracking? Is your home foundation in danger due to this technique used to extract underground gas? ~ The science is divided on the issue. Like on most other issues, from global warning to bigfoot, you will always find one scientist on one side and another scientist of the other of the issue. As you would expect, the businesses doing the fracking are adamant that there is no proof that fracking is causing any increases in local earthquakes or much less an increase of foundation problems for residents leaving near the fracking sites. However, the homeowners leaving with the sudden increase in slab and sheet rock cracking, have associated the foundation damage with the beginning of the fracking activity in the areas near them. Fracking is short for ``hydraulic fracturing'' and as the name implies, liquids are used to fraction masses of land and rocks in the soil to release and capture natural gas. Now, without getting too technical, some geologists swear that the fracking is happening to deep in the soil for anyone to notice, while others are saying that the increase in ground shifting is directly related to such activity. It would not take a long leap to see how that could be true. In the meantime, the city of Denton could make news by becoming the FIRST town in Texas to ban fracking all together. Denton sits right on top of the Barnett Shale, believed to be one of the largest natural gas reserves in U.S. If the ban takes place, the currently operating 275 wells would continue to operate but no new ones or re-activation of old ones would be allowed.

  isbn = {978-0-12-385001-0},
  abstract = {This chapter presents fracture criteria for predicting crack growth direction and crack initiation load under mixed Mode I and II loading. It starts by introducing a simple elliptical model that may be used to predict failure load but not the crack growth direction. The chapter then introduces the phenomenological maximum tensile stress and strain energy density criteria. The maximum energy release rate criterion based on the analysis of a small kink from the main crack tip is subsequently described. The chapter concludes with presentation and discussion of experimental data for verification of the mixed mode fracture criteria.
Publisher Summary
Prediction of crack growth involves two aspects, that is, when would the crack start to grow, and in what direction. Under Mode I conditions, the crack grows in its original direction. The fracture criterion thus can be established using either KI in Irwin's stress intensity factor theory, or GI in the energy release theory including the Griffith theory. Under general mixed mode conditions, experimental observations indicate that the crack will no longer grow in its original direction and KII also plays a role in crack growth. Hence, an appropriate fracture criterion is required to establish, to predict mixed mode crack extension. As in the Mode I fracture, both energy and near-tip stress field approaches are used in mixed mode fracture studies. In the energy balance approach, a small kink from the main crack tip is analyzed to determine the energy release rate along the direction of the kink.},

Publisher Summary
This chapter briefly introduces some special topics in fracture mechanics, including fracture of anisotropic solids, fracture of nonhomegenous matertials, and dynamic fracture mechanics. Fracture mechanics of nonhomogeneous materials has applications in macroscopically heterogeneous materials, such as functionally graded materials (FGMs), which have been developed to meet the increasing multifunctional structural performance requirements in engineering applications. Prediction of crack initiation and propagation in a dynamically loaded structure is based on dynamic fracture mechanics, which generally considers both inertia effects on the stresses and displacements, and loading rate effects on the constitutive responses of materials. This chapter also focuses on the fracture of fiber-reinforced materials. Composite materials, or simply composites, include fiber- and particulate-reinforced materials. Composites are heterogeneous materials at the microscopic scale. In continuum mechanics, properties of a composite are homogenized at the macroscopic level and the material is treated as a macroscopically, or statistically homogeneous material. The most successful composites for aerospace and other engineering applications have been fiber-reinforced polymer matrix materials. Fiber composites are usually modeled as anisotropic materials with three mutually orthogonal planes of symmerty.},

The cohesive zone concept was first introduced by Barenblatt and therefore the first section is devoted to the Barenblatt model. The general cohesive zone concept and its underlying physical mechanisms are subsequently described and both mechanismbased and phenomenological cohesive laws are introduced. The chapter then presents some fundamental issues regarding the initial cohesive curve shape and the relation between the cohesive zone model and linear elastic fracture mechanics predictions of fracture loads. Finally, cohesive zone models applied to interface cracks are discussed.
Publisher Summary
The cohesive zone fracture model was introduced partially to remove the stress singularity in the classical continuum crack model and partially to incorporate the physically more realistic material separation mechanisms at the atomic scale. The cohesive zone model adds a zone of vanishing thickness ahead of the crack tip with the intention of describing more realistically the fracture process without the use of stress singularity. The cohesive zone is idealized as two cohesive surfaces, which are held together by a cohesive traction. The material failure is characterized by the complete separation of the cohesive surfaces and the separation process is described by a cohesive law that relates the cohesive traction and the relative displacement of the cohesive surfaces. Hence, a physical crack extension occurs when the separation displacement at the tail of the cohesive zone (physical crack tip) reaches a critical value. One of the key advantages offered by the cohesive zone model is that it has an intrinsic fracture energy dissipation mechanism in contrast to the classical continuum based fracture mechanics for which such a mechanism is absent.},

The chapter starts with Williams' crack tip stress analyses using the eigenfunction expansion method and explains the oscillatory nature of the crack tip fields. The complex potential formulations and examples of stress intensity factors are then presented followed by a detailed discussion of stress intensity factor definition for interface cracks and the size of the crack surface contact zone near the crack tip. The energy release rate concept for interface cracks is presented with a detailed discussion of the effect of oscillatory stress/displacement fields on the definition of energy release rates for interface cracks. The finite crack extension energy release and displacement ratio approaches are introduced and used to calculate stress intensity factors. Energy release rate based interface fracture criteria are described for crack growth along the interface as well as crack kink out of the interface. Finally, the crack surface contact and friction under shear-dominated loading are discussed.
Publisher Summary
For homogeneous materials, the crack tip stress and displacement fields play a central role in establishing fracture parameters for investigating interface fracture. The asymptotic eigenfunction expansion method is used to analyze the interface crack tip fields but the characteristic equations for determining the eigenvalue or the stress singularity index is much more complex due to the material property mismatch along the interface. In analyzing the asymptotic crack tip stress and displacement fields, it is sufficient to consider a semi-infinite crack lying at the interface between two dissimilar homogeneous materials. The crack surface contact zone and the stress oscillation zone near an interface crack tip are analyzed using the oscillatory crack tip fields. In addition, the oscillatory nature of stress and displacement fields near the tip of an interfacial crack implies contact of the crack surfaces. When the contact zone size is smaller than the crack length and other in-plane dimensions, such as in bimaterial cracks under Mode I loading, the oscillatory crack tip fields is used to predict interfacial fracture.},

Two approaches commonly included in linear elastic fracture chapters are first introduced as plastic deformations prevail at the crack tip, i.e., Irwin's adjusted stress intensity factor approach and the crack growth resistance curve approach based on the adjusted stress intensity factor. The chapter subsequently introduces and discusses commonly used elastic-plastic crack growth criteria, i.e., the J-integral criterion, the crack opening displacement (COD) criterion, and the crack tip opening angle (CTOA) criterion.
Publisher Summary
This chapter introduces various fracture criteria for predicting quasistatic crack growth in materials undergoing plastic deformations. In linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM), the near-tip stress and strain fields are always characterized by the inverse square-root singularity and the stress intensity factor is a fracture parameter for both crack initiation and propagation. In elastic-plastic fracture mechanics, it is much more difficult to find a similar parameter directly characterizing the intensity of the near-tip singular deformation field for both stationary and growing cracks under large-scale yielding (LSY) conditions. Elastic-plastic fracture criteria are thickness-dependent, that is, the critical value of the fracture parameter varies with specimen thickness.},

Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the plasticity effects around a crack tip; for example, the stress and deformation fields, plastic zone size and shape, and crack tip opening displacement (CTOD). Knowledge of the plastic zone shape and size around a crack is useful to understand the plasticity effect on the fracture behavior of solids. Solutions of stresses in both elastic and plastic regions are required to determine the plastic zone shape. If the plastic zone around the crack tip is small compared to the region in which the crack tip K-fields apply, the singular elastic stress fields is used to estimate the plastic zone shape. The estimates thus obtained, however, are the first-order approximations because the stress redistribution caused by the small plastic zone is not considered. In elastic-plastic fracture mechanics, a parallel issue to the elastic crack tip K-field is the stress and deformation fields near a crack tip in an elastic-plastic material. The chapter also discusses energy release rate concept in elastic-plastic materials. Energy release rate plays a very important role in Griffith's theory of fracture. It is a common notion that a crack extends because of the surplus energy released to provide the energy needed in creating new surfaces during crack growth.},

The relation between the energy release rate and stress intensity factor is established using Irwin's crack closure approach. The chapter then moves on to the J-integral including its definition, pathindependence, and the relation between the J-integral and the stress intensity factor. Finally, a finite element method based on the modified crack closure technique for numerically calculating stress intensity factors is described and applied to investigate the three-dimensional effects in a cracked plate with finite thickness.
Publisher Summary
Fracture occurs when the stress intensity factor reaches its critical value, that is, the fracture toughness. In the energy approach, the fracture behavior of a material is described by the energy variation of the cracked system during crack extension, which is characterized by the so-called energy release rate. The energy release is considered a global exercise of the cracked system. This chapter also discusses three-dimensional field near crack front; most linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) problems are simplified and modeled as two-dimensional (2-D), though three-dimensional (3-D) effects are often acknowledged. 2-D plane strain and plane stress states are often assumed to approximate thin and thick bodies, respectively. In addition, a stress intensity factor calculation using the finite element method is examined. The finite element method is commonly used in the stress analyses of complex engineering structures. Various techniques have been introduced to calculate stress intensity factors and energy release rates. Two commonly used methods are briefly described.},

Finally, the chapter presents the K-dominance concept and introduces the stress intensity factor fracture criterion and fracture toughness concept.
Publisher Summary
Brittle fracture in a solid in the form of crack growth is governed by the stress field around the crack tip and by parameters that describe the resistance of the material to crack growth. Thus, the analysis of stresses near the crack tip constitutes an essential part of fracture mechanics. There are three independent movements corresponding to three fundamental fracture modes. These basic fracture modes are usually called Mode I, Mode II, and Mode III, respectively, and any fracture mode in a cracked body may be described by one of the three basic modes, or their combinations. The three basic modes of crack deformation can be more precisely defined by the associated stresses ahead of the crack front, which are considered as the crack, tip in two-dimensional problems. In addition, method of complex potential for plane elasticity is discussed. Among various mathematical methods in plane elasticity, the complex potential function method by Kolosov and Muskhelishvili are one of the powerful and convenient methods to treat two-dimensional crack problems. In the complex potential method, stresses and displacements are expressed in terms of analytic functions of complex variables. The problem of obtaining stresses and displacements around a crack tip is converted to finding some analytic functions subjected to appropriate boundary conditions.},

Publisher Summary
The theoretical strength of a solid is usually understood as the applied stress that fractures a perfect crystal of the material by breaking the atomic bonds along the fractured surfaces. The theoretical strength is estimated using the interatomic bonding force versus the atomic separation relation. Failure of a solid is characterized by separation of the body. At the atomistic level, the fracture strength of a ``perfect'' material depends on the strength of its atomic bonds. In addition, Griffith postulated that all bulk glasses contain numerous minute flaws in the form of microcracks that act as stress concentration generators. This new concept accompanied by the energy release approach that he introduced started the era of modern fracture mechanics. The Griffith theory for fracture of perfectly brittle elastic solids is founded on the principle of energy conservation, that is, energy added to and released from the body must be the same as that dissipated during crack extension.},

Publisher Summary
This chapter provides an overview on fracture mechanic concepts and discusses various fundamentals like failure of solids. Failure of solids and structures can take various forms. A structure may fail without breaking the material, such as in elastic buckling. However, failure of the material in a structure leads to failure of the structure. Fracture mechanics is a subject of engineering science that deals with failure of solids caused by crack initiation and propagation. There are two basic approaches to establish fracture criteria, or crack propagation criteria: crack tip stress field (local) and energy balance (global) approaches. In the crack tip field approach, the crack tip stress and displacement states are first analyzed and parameters governing the near tip stress and displacement fields are identified. A fundamental concept of fracture mechanics is to accept the theoretical stress singularity at the crack tip but not use the stress directly to determine failure/crack extension. This is based on the fact that the tip stress is limited by the yield stress or the cohesive stress between atoms and singular stresses are the results of linear elasticity. It is also recognized that the singular stress field is a convenient representation of the actual finite stress field if the discrepancy between the two lies in a small region near the crack tip. This notion is referred to as small-scale yielding.},

The curves each show a sharp bend at a temperature between 840\textdegree{} and 1050\textdegree{}C, which is designated the aggregation temperature Ta. If we divide these curves by the corresponding percentage substituted, we get curves for each oxide which are straight and parallel below the aggregation temperatures, the slopes (increase of change of log10{$\eta$} per 100\textdegree{}C) being -0.056 (CaO), -0.055 (MgO), -0.018 (A12O3) per per cent oxide substituted. For substitution of 1/2 molecule the slopes are -0.325 (CaO), -0.23 (MgO) and -0.18 (Al2O3) per 100\textdegree.

Evidence of Aggregation in Glasses, from viscosity Measurements The sharp bends in the plots of change of log10{$\eta$} due to substitution of an oxide for Na2O, suggest the beginning of molecular aggregation at these temperatures. These aggregation temperatures are close to the devitrification temperatures, but the effect on the viscosity curves cannot be due to actual devitrification since it does not change with time. Taking the aggregation temperatures as equal to devitrification temperatures, additional isotherms are roughly sketched into the equilibrium triangle of the system Na2O-CaO-SiO2. Change of Viscosity of Glass (4SiO2, 2Na2O) due to of Substitution of B2O3 for SiO2 The change of log10{$\eta$} (from the results of English) is plotted as a function of temperature, and also the change of log10{$\eta$} per per cent B2O3. The curves are more complex than for the substitution for Na2O.},

  abstract = {Recent attempts have been made to assess the relative merits of the free volume and entropytheories of viscous flow in glass-forming liquids by accurate measurement of viscosity over wide temperature ranges, and subsequent comparison with the equations derived from these theories. In the author\&apos;s view, this effort is misguided. The theories are crude and qualitative, and such tests are too stringent. It is better to make qualitative or semiquantitative comparison of a wide variety of physical phenomena; judged by this criterion, the entropytheory appears more successful. It is conjectured that further progress can be made by accepting the crude, naive character of any model we are likely to find tractable for the foreseeable future, and recognizing both the values and limitations of such models. A picture of the flow process in viscous liquids is proposed, in an attempt to answer certain questions about the molecular steps in flow either answered unsuccessfully or ignored by present theories, in the hope that it will lead a model closer to molecular reality but still sufficiently tractable to allow some range of predictive value. The model is based on the idea that in ``viscous'' liquids (shear relaxation time {$\geq$}10-9 sec) flow is dominated by potential barriers high compared to thermal energies, while at higher temperature, this will no longer be true. Certain concepts borrowed from the continuum theory of lattice defects are joined to a qualitative description of viscous flow due to Orowan, to provide a picture which leads to some qualitative predictions about flow and relaxation in the liquid and glassy states.},

In this description, the strong Coulombic interaction between an excited electron and the charged vacancy it leaves behind (a hole) is automatically taken into account. If, in an optical microcavity, the exciton\textendash{}photon interaction is strong compared to the excitonic and photonic decay rates, a second quasiparticle, the microcavity polariton, must be introduced to properly account for this coupling. Coherent, laser-like emission from polaritons has been predicted to occur when the ground-state occupancy of polaritons ngs, reaches 1 (ref. 3). This process, known as polariton lasing, can occur at thresholds much lower than required for conventional lasing. Polaritons in organic semiconductors are highly stable at room temperature, but to our knowledge, there has as yet been no report of nonlinear emission from these structures. Here, we demonstrate polariton lasing at room temperature in an organic microcavity composed of a melt-grown anthracene single crystal sandwiched between two dielectric mirrors.},

After describing well-established classes such as fluorite- and perovskite-based oxides, new materials and structure-types are presented. These include a variety of molybdate, gallate, apatite silicate/germanate and niobate systems, many of which contain flexible structural networks, and exhibit different defect properties and transport mechanisms to the conventional materials. It is concluded that the rich chemistry of these important systems provides diverse possibilities for developing superior ionic conductors for use as solid electrolytes in fuel cells and related applications. In most cases, a greater atomic-level understanding of the structures, defects and conduction mechanisms is achieved through a combination of experimental and computational techniques (217 references).},

One of the significant improvements in nanoindentation testing is the continuous stiffness measurement (CSM) technique. It offers a direct measure of dynamic contact stiffness during the loading portion of an indentation test and, being somewhat insensitive to thermal drift, allows an accurate observation of small volume deformation. Nanoscale damage caused by fatigue is of critical importance to the reliability of ultrathin protective overcoats and micro/nanostructures. The cyclic loading used in the CSM makes the technique useful for the evaluation of nanofatigue. Methodologies of the CSM technique used for the characterization of layered materials and nonhomogeneous composites are reviewed and discussed. Applications of the CSM technique to the measurement of contact stiffness, elastic modulus, hardness, creep resistance, and fatigue properties of the materials used in magnetic storage devices are presented. The nanoindentation CSM technique, in conjunction with nanoscratch and friction and wear tests, can be satisfactorily used for the materials characterization of magnetic storage and microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices and should find more application.},

The materials included fused silica, soda-lime glass, and single crystals of aluminum, tungsten, quartz, and sapphire. It is shown that the load-displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load. The hardnesses and elastic moduli of the six materials are computed using the analysis procedure and compared with values determined by independent means to assess the accuracy of the method. The results show that with good technique, moduli can be measured to within 5\%.},

  abstract = {Tensile tests have been carried out on single crystals of anthracene over a range of temperatures and strain rates. A yield point is observed and plastic deformation occurs by slip in either the [010] or [110] directions in the basal plane. The yield point appears to be due to an initial difficulty in dislocation generation followed by a rapid multiplication of dislocations on yielding, rather than an impurity-locking effect. The critical shear stress for yielding and the appearance or non-appearance of the yield point are dependent on the surface finish of the crystals, presumably because the active dislocation sources are mainly at the surface. At temperatures less than T/TM = 0.67 for slip on (001) [010] the Peierls force appears to be a major factor in determining the critical shear stress for plastic deformation to begin, while for slip on (001) [110] the stress field due to defects probably makes a major contribution. On a effectu{\'e} des essais de traction sur des monocristaux d'anthrac{\`e}ne dans un certain domaine de temp{\'e}ratures et de vitesses de d{\'e}formation. On observe un crochet de traction; la d{\'e}formation plastique se produit par glissement dans l'une ou l'autre des directions [010] ou [110] dans le plan de base. L'origine du crochet de traction semble {\^e}tre une difficult{\'e} initiale dans la production des dislocations suivie d'une multiplication rapide des dislocations au coure de la d{\'e}formation plastique, plut{\^o}t qu'un effet de blocage par les impuret{\'e}s. La cission critique de d{\'e}formation plastique et l'apparition ou la non apparition du crochet de traction d{\'e}pendent du fini de la surface des cristaux, probablement parce que les sources actives de dislocations se trouvent principalement {\`a} la surface. A des temp{\'e}ratures inf{\'e}rieures {\`a} T/TM = 0,67, pour le glissement sur (001)[010], la force de Peierls semble {\^e}tre un facteur essentiel dans la d{\'e}termination de la cission critique n{\'e}cessaire pour provoquer la d{\'e}formation plastique, tandis que pour le glissement sur (001)[110], c'est probablement la champ de contraintes d{\`u} aux d{\'e}fauts qui donne une contribution pr{\'e}pond{\'e}rante.

These are obtained by accounting for the competition between the strain energy in the material from local stress concentrations and dislocation slip. Central to this theory is the introduction of a statistical entropy term that accounts for the energetically favourable dislocation migration paths, which determine the dynamic recovery, twin nucleation and growth rates. Deformation by dislocation slip, at strains before twinning occurs, is described by theory previously derived for FCC metals and now applied to HCP materials without additional considerations. A dislocation generation term accounting for twin propagation is added to the evolution equation. Such term becomes active once a critical strain for twin nucleation is reached. Only physical parameters are employed as input. The new theory is successful in describing work hardening and twin volume fraction evolution of Ti, Zr, Mg and Mg-based alloys for various temperature and orientation conditions.},

  abstract = {Precipitation hardening, also called age hardening, is a heat treatment technique used to increase the yield strength of malleable materials, including most structural alloys of aluminium, magnesium, nickel, titanium, and some steels and stainless steels. In superalloys, it is known to cause yield strength anomaly providing excellent high-temperature strength.
Precipitation hardening relies on changes in solid solubility with temperature to produce fine particles of an impurity phase, which impede the movement of dislocations, or defects in a crystal's lattice. Since dislocations are often the dominant carriers of plasticity, this serves to harden the material. The impurities play the same role as the particle substances in particle-reinforced composite materials. Just as the formation of ice in air can produce clouds, snow, or hail, depending upon the thermal history of a given portion of the atmosphere, precipitation in solids can produce many different sizes of particles, which have radically different properties. Unlike ordinary tempering, alloys must be kept at elevated temperature for hours to allow precipitation to take place. This time delay is called "aging". Solution treatment and aging is sometimes abbreviated "STA" in metals specs and certs.
Note that two different heat treatments involving precipitates can alter the strength of a material: solution heat treating and precipitation heat treating. Solid solution strengthening involves formation of a single-phase solid solution via quenching. Precipitation heat treating involves the addition of impurity particles to increase a material's strength. Precipitation hardening via precipitation heat treatment is the main topic of discussion in this article.},

It is based on the observation that grain boundaries impede dislocation movement and that the number of dislocations within a grain have an effect on how easily dislocations can traverse grain boundaries and travel from grain to grain. So, by changing grain size one can influence dislocation movement and yield strength. For example, heat treatment after plastic deformation and changing the rate of solidification are ways to alter grain size.},

The technique works by adding atoms of one element (the alloying element) to the crystalline lattice of another element (the base metal), forming a solid solution. The local nonuniformity in the lattice due to the alloying element makes plastic deformation more difficult by impeding dislocation motion. In contrast, alloying beyond the solubility limit can form a second phase, leading to strengthening via other mechanisms (e.g. the precipitation of intermetallic compounds).},

  abstract = {Work hardening, also known as strain hardening or cold working, is the strengthening of a metal by plastic deformation. This strengthening occurs because of dislocation movements and dislocation generation within the crystal structure of the material. Many non-brittle metals with a reasonably high melting point as well as several polymers can be strengthened in this fashion. Alloys not amenable to heat treatment, including low-carbon steel, are often work-hardened. Some materials cannot be work-hardened at low temperatures, such as indium, however others can only be strengthened via work hardening, such as pure copper and aluminum.
Work hardening may be desirable or undesirable depending on the context. An example of undesirable work hardening is during machining when early passes of a cutter inadvertently work-harden the workpiece surface, causing damage to the cutter during the later passes. Certain alloys are more prone to this than others; superalloys such as Inconel require machining strategies that take it into account. An example of desirable work hardening is that which occurs in metalworking processes that intentionally induce plastic deformation to exact a shape change. These processes are known as cold working or cold forming processes. They are characterized by shaping the workpiece at a temperature below its recrystallization temperature, usually at ambient temperature. Cold forming techniques are usually classified into four major groups: squeezing, bending, drawing, and shearing. Applications include the heading of bolts and cap screws and the finishing of cold rolled steel. In cold forming, metal is formed at high speed and high pressure using tool steel or carbide dies. The cold working of the metal increasing the hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength.},

For a constant stress, strain, and temperature, the activation energy for creep varies continuously from 67 kcal per mole for the near-stoichiometric condition to about 33 kcal per mole for the highest degree of reduction. The activation energy for creep in hydrogen-reduced rutile is about 80 kcal per mole and this leads to the conclusion that the rate-controlling mechanism and/or defect are not the same for hydrogen- and vacuum-reduced rutile.

  abstract = {Actuators based on soft dielectric elastomers deform due to electric field induced Maxwell's stress, interacting with the mechanical properties of the material. The relatively high operating voltages of such actuators can be reduced by increasing the permittivity of the active material, while maintaining the mechanical properties and high electrical breakdown strength. Approaches relying on the use of highly polarizable molecules or conjugated polymers have so far provided the best results, however it has been difficult to maintain high breakdown strengths. In this work, a new approach for increasing the electrostatic energy density of a soft polymer based on molecular composites is presented, relying on chemically grafting soft gel-state {$\pi$}-conjugated conducting macromolecules (polyaniline (PANI)) to a flexible elastomer backbone SEBS-g-MA (poly-styrene-co-ethylene-co-butylene-co-styrene-g-maleic anhydride). The approach was found to result in composites of increased permittivity (470\% over the elastomer matrix) with hardly any reduction in breakdown strength (from 140 to 120 V {$\mu$}m-1), resulting in a large increase in stored electrostatic energy. This led to an improvement in the measured electromechanical response as well as in the maximum actuation strain. A transition was observed when amounts of PANI exceeded 2 vol\%, which was ascribed to the exhaustion of the MA-functionality of the SEBS-g-MA. The transition led to drastic increases in permittivity and conductivity, and a sharp drop in electrical breakdown strength. Although the transition caused further improvement of the electromechanical response, the reduction in electrical breakdown strength caused a limitation of the maximum achievable actuation strain.},

The low temperature-high stress behaviour for Cu and Cu-30\% Zn was found to be consistent with the dominance of a dislocation intersection mechanism. The high temperature-low stress data for the pure metals suggest that the rate-controlling process involves the nonconservative motion of jogs on screw dislocations.

When it is twisted, it exerts a force (actually torque) in the opposite direction, proportional to the amount (angle) it is twisted. There are two types. A torsion bar is a straight bar of metal or rubber that is subjected to twisting (shear stress) about its axis by torque applied at its ends. A more delicate form used in sensitive instruments, called a torsion fiber consists of a fiber of silk, glass, or quartz under tension, that is twisted about its axis. The other type, a helical torsion spring, is a metal rod or wire in the shape of a helix (coil) that is subjected to twisting about the axis of the coil by sideways forces (bending moments) applied to its ends, twisting the coil tighter. This terminology can be confusing because in a helical torsion spring the forces acting on the wire are actually bending stresses, not torsional (shear) stresses.[1] [2]},

  abstract = {The speed of sound is the distance travelled per unit time by a sound wave as it propagates through an elastic medium. In dry air at 20 \textdegree{}C (68 \textdegree{}F), the speed of sound is 343.2 metres per second (1,126 ft/s; 1,236 km/h; 768 mph; 667 kn), or a kilometre in 2.914 s or a mile in 4.689 s.
The speed of sound in an ideal gas depends only on its temperature and composition. The speed has a weak dependence on frequency and pressure in ordinary air, deviating slightly from ideal behavior.
In common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example (as noted above), sound travels at 343.2 m/s in air; it travels at 1,484 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron. In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 m/s; which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions.
Sound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), but there is also a different type of sound wave called a shear wave, which occurs only in solids. These different types of waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in seismology. The speed of a compression sound wave in solids is determined by the medium's compressibility, shear modulus and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.
In fluid dynamics, the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the fluid is called the object's Mach number. Objects moving at speeds greater than Mach1 are said to be traveling at supersonic speeds.},

@misc{wikipedia_matrix_nodate,
  title = {Matrix Multiplication},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {In mathematics, matrix multiplication is a binary operation that takes a pair of matrices, and produces another matrix. Numbers such as the real or complex numbers can be multiplied according to elementary arithmetic. On the other hand, matrices are arrays of numbers, so there is no unique way to define "the" multiplication of matrices. As such, in general the term "matrix multiplication" refers to a number of different ways to multiply matrices. The key features of any matrix multiplication include: the number of rows and columns the original matrices have (called the "size", "order" or "dimension"), and specifying how the entries of the matrices generate the new matrix.
Like vectors, matrices of any size can be multiplied by scalars, which amounts to multiplying every entry of the matrix by the same number. Similar to the entrywise definition of adding or subtracting matrices, multiplication of two matrices of the same size can be defined by multiplying the corresponding entries, and this is known as the Hadamard product. Another definition is the Kronecker product of two matrices, to obtain a block matrix.
One can form many other definitions. However, the most useful definition can be motivated by linear equations and linear transformations on vectors, which have numerous applications in applied mathematics, physics, and engineering. This definition is often called the matrix product. In words, if A is an n \texttimes{} m matrix and B is an m \texttimes{} p matrix, their matrix product AB is an n \texttimes{} p matrix, in which the m entries across the rows of A are multiplied with the m entries down the columns of B (the precise definition is below).
This definition is not always commutative, although it still retains the associative property and is distributive over entrywise addition of matrices. The identity element of the matrix product is the identity matrix (analogous to multiplying numbers by 1), and a square matrix may have an inverse matrix (analogous to the multiplicative inverse of a number). Determinant multiplicativity applies to the matrix product. The matrix product is an important operation in linear transformations, matrix groups, and the theory of group representations and irreps.
Computing matrix products is both a central operation in many numerical algorithms and potentially time consuming, making it one of the most well-studied problems in numerical computing. Various algorithms have been devised for computing C = AB, especially for large matrices.
This article will use the following notational conventions: matrices are represented by capital letters in bold, e.g. A, vectors in lowercase bold, e.g. a, and entries of vectors and matrices are italic (since they are numbers from a field), e.g. A and a. Index notation is often the clearest way to express definitions, and is used as standard in the literature. The i, j entry of matrix A is indicated by (A)ij or Aij, whereas a numerical label (not matrix entries) on a collection of matrices is subscripted only, e.g. A1, A2, etc.},

  abstract = {Four medical grade silicones were swollen, until they reached equilibrium (i.e. constant mass) in eight liquids at 25 \textdegree{}C. The greatest swelling was obtained with n-heptane but the volume fraction, {$\phi$}, of the silicones in their swollen state was not significantly different (p {$<$} 0.05) in this liquid than in cyclohexane. For each grade of silicone, {$\phi$} was plotted against {$\delta$}l, the liquid solubility parameter, for each liquid in which it was swollen. A second-order polynomial was plotted through the results; the minimum in this polynomial provided a value for the polymer solubility parameter, {$\delta$}p. The Flory polymer\textendash{}liquid interaction parameter, {$\chi$}, was calculated for the four best liquids, using Hildebrand's solubility parameter theory. An alternative method for calculating {$\chi$}, directly from swelling measurements, was shown to produce physically unreasonable results. The cross-link density, {$\upsilon$}, was calculated, from {$\phi$} and {$\chi$}, for each grade of silicone, using the Flory\textendash{}Rehner equation. Since the values of two parameters involved in Hildebrand's theory cannot be determined reliably and because the Flory\textendash{}Rehner equation is an approximation, absolute values of {$\upsilon$} cannot be obtained. However, the relative values of {$\upsilon$} obtained were higher for the harder grades then for the softer grades and similarly, the grades with the higher Young's modulus had higher {$\upsilon$} values.},

The original Flory\textendash{}Huggins theoretical approach, using a lattice model to compute the statistical thermodynamics, provides the basic understanding of the thermodynamic processes involved but is deficient in describing most real systems, and has little or no predictive capability. We have developed an approach using a lattice integral equation theory, and in this paper we demonstrate that this not only describes well the literature data on polymer mixtures but allows new insights into the behaviour of polymers and their mixtures. The characteristic parameters obtained by fitting the data have been successfully shown to be transferable from one dataset to another, to be able to correctly predict behaviour outside the experimental range of the original data and to allow meaningful comparisons to be made between different polymer mixtures.},

On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5\% (35 g/L, or 599 mM), which is a specific gravity of about 1.025. This means that every kilogram (roughly one litre by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams (1.2 oz) of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions). Average density at the surface is 1.025 g/ml. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 g/ml at 4 \textdegree{}C (39 \textdegree{}F)) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about -2 \textdegree{}C (28 \textdegree{}F). The coldest seawater ever recorded (in a liquid state) was in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic glacier, and measured -2.6 \textdegree{}C (27.3 \textdegree{}F). Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4. However, there is no universally accepted reference pH-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units.},

Totally noninvasive methods of analysis were used, including X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, Raman microspectroscopy, visible reflectance spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction; moreover, the feasibility of using a portable Raman spectrometer for the in-field identification of jades has been demonstrated. Fe/Fe+Mg (\% p.f.u.) ratios of the jades have been calculated based on hydroxyl stretching Raman bands, which will provide an important addition to similar data that are being collected at major museums in the Western and Eastern hemispheres.

  abstract = {The health of coral reefs and calcareous plankton is strongly influenced by the carbonate saturation state of seawater. Calculations of carbonate saturation states currently require measurements of two CO2 system parameters, such as pH and total dissolved carbon, plus thermodynamic calculations that relate carbonate ion concentrations to directly measured parameters. In this work we report novel procedures for direct measurements of carbonate ion concentrations and saturation states in seawater. Measurements are obtained via ultraviolet spectroscopic observations of Pb(II) spectra as the relative concentrations of PbCO30 and an ensemble of lead chloride complexes vary in response to dissolved CO32-. Measurement precision is enhanced by parameterization in terms of absorbance ratios. The PbCO30 stability constant, and Pb(II) molar absorbance ratios in seawater, were determined at 25~\textdegree{}C over a range of salinity between 36 and 20. The procedures described in this work are well suited to measurements throughout the normal range of carbonate ion concentrations in the oceans. Rapid equilibration rates for Pb(II) carbonate complexation make the procedures described in this work well suited to rapid direct analysis in situ.},

They provide a broad range of technical applications such as soldering in automotive processing, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and solar panels. Due to the fascinating variety of microstructural changes solder materials underlie, their micromorphological dynamics have been extensively studied in the past decades by experimental, analytical and numerical approaches. The evolved microstructure exerts a significant effect, in particular, in very small components such as solder joints in microelectronic packages. In order to capture the essence of the microstructural evolution in solder alloys with a diffusion theory of heterogeneous solid mixtures we employ an extended Cahn\textendash{}Hilliard phase-field model. In our contribution we introduce different numerical schemes to treat Cahn\textendash{}Hilliard equation. Here we focus on the innovative isogeometric finite element approach and outline its considerable benefits in comparison to the other methods. To this end we present numerical simulations of phase decomposition and coarsening controlled by diffusion for eutectic binary solders Sn\textendash{}Pb and Ag\textendash{}Cu illustrating the versatility of this approach. A concluding computational study of a three-dimensional phase separation event within a solder ball geometry will corroborate the quality of our model.},

The lengthening of these crystals proceeds by volume diffusion of Cu to the {$\alpha$}:{$\alpha$} grain boundaries, followed by grain boundary diffusion to the advancing edges of the allotriomorphs.

Interfacial segregation and precipitation involving alloy species apparently affected precipitation in the matrix, where the distribution of phases was found to be very heterogeneous. Matrix phases also included unusually large constituent particles and dispersoids, a consequence of the composite processing methods. The relationship between the observed microstructure and the composite mechanical behavior reported by others is discussed.

Further, it is likely that wootz Damascus blades with damascene patterns may have been produced only from wootz ingots supplied from those regions of India having appropriate impurity-containing ore deposits.},

  abstract = {A new interpretation of the habits of ice growing from vapour is proposed. The basic habits of ice alternate three times: plates (A) {\^a}\textdagger{}' -4{\^A}\textdegree{}C {\^a}\textdagger{}' columns (B) {\^a}\textdagger{}' -10{\^A}\textdegree{}C {\^a}\textdagger{}' plates (C) {\^a}\textdagger{}' between -20{\^A}\textdegree{}C and -35{\^A}\textdegree{}C {\^a}\textdagger{}' columns (D). The theory is based on a view- that the surface of ice just below 0{\^A}\textdegree{}C is covered with a quasi-liquid layer, whose thickness {\"I}` or coverage {\^I}\textasciiacute{} decreases with falling temperature, and therefore the growth mechanism of a crystal face changes also as follows: (I) Vapour{\^a}\texteuro{}''Quasi-Liquid{\^a}\texteuro{}'' Solid mechanism ({\^I}\textasciiacute{} \&gt; 1), (II) Adhesive Growth on a surface strongly adsorbed by H2O molecules (0.02 \&lt; {\^I}\textasciiacute{} \&lt; 1) and (III) Two- Dimensional Nucleation Growth on a surface with low eigen adsorption ({\^I}\textasciiacute{} \&lt; 0.02). The type of surface structure and consequently the growth mechanism depends on the surface orientation and the temperature. The complicated habit change is caused mainly by the combination of surface kinetics of the \{0001\} and \{101\&amp;\#x0304;10\} face. The first and second conversion temperature (TAB, TBC) are expected to be independent of the absolute supersaturation {\^I}\textasciiacute{}P as found in experiments. On the other hand, the third (TCD) is the temperature where the usual two-dimensional nucleation growth rate of the \{0001\} face reaches the one of the \{1010\} face, and exceeds it by the effect of diffusion field, so that the third conversion temperature falls with decreasing {\^I}\textasciiacute{}P. The marked columnar crystals observed at -7{\^A}\textdegree{}C can be explained only by taking into account the spherical volume diffusion field near the \{0001\} face and a cylindrical one near the \{101\&amp;\#x0304;10\} face. For plate-like crystals between -10{\^A}\textdegree{}C and -20{\^A}\textdegree{}C to -35{\^A}\textdegree{}C the surface diffusion from \{0001\} to \{1010\} and volume diffision with cylindrical symmetry near \{101\&amp;\#x0304;10\} faces is very important.},

A model is proposed for the explanation of this phenomenon. We suggest that the interplay of the liquid-solid interfacial energy with the silicon surface energy expressed in terms of an edge tension is responsible for the change of the growth direction. The value of the edge tension is estimated by the product of the interfacial thickness with the surface energy of silicon. For large diameters, the direction with the lowest interfacial energy is dominant, whereas for small diameters the surface energy of the silicon nanowire determines the preferential growth direction.},

By forming a nanometer size electron probe, TEM is unique in identifying and quantifying the chemical and electronic structure of individual nanocrystals. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy analysis of the solid-state effects and mapping the valence states are even more attractive. In situ TEM is demonstrated for characterizing and measuring the thermodynamic, electric, and mechanical properties of individual nanostructures, from which the structureproperty relationship can be registered with a specific nanoparticle/structure.},

  abstract = {The thermodynamic formalism with the [Omega] potential is applied for finding the conditions of mechanical equilibrium (Laplace's law and Young's equation) in the case of small liquid droplets attached at a plane surface. The conditions of stability of the equilibrium drops are examined. It is shown that at positive values of the line tension of the contact perimeter there exists a supersaturation above which no heterogeneous nucleation occurs. Below this maximum value of the supersaturation two equilibrium cap-shaped drops could coexist. They are both in unstable equilibrium with their surroundings. No range of supersaturations exists where the smaller equilibrium drop would be in stable equilibrium with the surroundings. Such a conclusion has been proposed (V.C. Noninski, Colloids Surfaces, 42 (1989) 205; J. Colloid Interface Sci., 143 (1991) 374) on the basis of the incorrect assumption that the stability of the equilibrium could be referred to the slope of the Thomson--Gibbs dependence of vapour pressure on drop size. Positive slopes of this dependence imply stability equilibrium in the case of free drops only. For the case of cap-shaped drops where the [Omega] potential is a function of two (or more) geometrical variables, the determination of the stability conditions follows another procedure shown in the present paper.},

  abstract = {Free energy minimization may seem like an universally valid method to single out the thermodynamic equilibrium states among a certain set of imaginable system states. Nevertheless, especially for capillary systems, it happens that false minima arise in the free energy functions chosen which are incompatible with the Young contact angle condition. In the present paper we elucidate this question for the case of a gas bubble submerged in water and adhering to a planar hydrophobic wall at constant chemical potentials. In particular, it is shown that by assuming a priori the Laplace condition, one finds a mechanically unstable (i.e. false) minimum of geometric origin when the contact angle [theta] is equal to 90\textdegree, and, in addition, a (correct) maximum at some angle [theta]{$>$}90\textdegree{} where the Young condition is fulfilled. On the other hand, still assuming a spherical bubble shape but considering the [Omega]-potential of the contact angle system to be a function of two geometric variables (bubble radius, r and height, h, instead of just h), only one extremum is obtained: The maximum arising for an angle [theta]{$>$}90\textdegree. Physically, our analysis implies that stable attachment of a small gas bubble to an ideal, molecularly smooth, hydrophobic solid surface at constant chemical potentials will not occur.},

This implies that the low-temperature equilibrium shapes of many metal crystals should be heavily faceted. The predicted instability of vicinal metal surfaces is at variance with the almost generally observed stability of these surfaces. We argue that the unstable orientations undergo a defaceting transition at relatively low temperatures, driven by the high vibrational entropy of steps.},

  abstract = {Solar cells are attractive candidates for clean and renewable power1, 2; with miniaturization, they might also serve as integrated power sources for nanoelectronic systems. The use of nanostructures or nanostructured materials represents a general approach to reduce both cost and size and to improve efficiency in photovoltaics1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Nanoparticles, nanorods and nanowires have been used to improve charge collection efficiency in polymer-blend4 and dye-sensitized solar cells5, 6, to demonstrate carrier multiplication7, and to enable low-temperature processing of photovoltaic devices3, 4, 5, 6. Moreover, recent theoretical studies have indicated that coaxial nanowire structures could improve carrier collection and overall efficiency with respect to single-crystal bulk semiconductors of the same materials8, 9. However, solar cells based on hybrid nanoarchitectures suffer from relatively low efficiencies and poor stabilities1. In addition, previous studies have not yet addressed their use as photovoltaic power elements in nanoelectronics. Here we report the realization of p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) coaxial silicon nanowire solar cells. Under one solar equivalent (1-sun) illumination, the p-i-n silicon nanowire elements yield a maximum power output of up to 200 pW per nanowire device and an apparent energy conversion efficiency of up to 3.4 per cent, with stable and improved efficiencies achievable at high-flux illuminations. Furthermore, we show that individual and interconnected silicon nanowire photovoltaic elements can serve as robust power sources to drive functional nanoelectronic sensors and logic gates. These coaxial silicon nanowire photovoltaic elements provide a new nanoscale test bed for studies of photoinduced energy/charge transport and artificial photosynthesis10, and might find general usage as elements for powering ultralow-power electronics11 and diverse nanosystems12, 13.},

  abstract = {Isothermal and continuous-cooling transformation kinetics have been measured dilatometrically for the {$\gamma$} \textrightarrow{} {$\alpha$} + {$\gamma{'}$} and {$\gamma{'}$} \textrightarrow{} P reactions in a 1025 steel. The isothermal transformation of austenite for each reaction was found to fit the Avrami equation after the fraction transformed was normalized to unity at the completion of the reaction and a transformation-start time was determined. The transformation kinetics under isothermal conditions therefore were characterized in terms of the n and b parameters from the Avrami equation together with the transformation-start times. The parameter n was found to be independent of temperature over the range studied (645 to 760 \textdaggerdbl{}C) and to have values of 0.99 and 1.33 for the ferrite and pearlite reactions, respectively. This indicates that the nucleation condition is essentially constant and site saturation occurs early in the transformation process. The continuous-cooling experiments were conducted at cooling rates of 2 to 150 \textdaggerdbl{}C per second to determine the transformation-start times for the ferrite and pearlite reactions and the completion time for transformation to pearlite under CCT conditions. Both reactions were found to obey the Additivity Principle for continuous cooling provided that the incubation (pre-transformation) period was not included in the transformation time. The isothermal transformation data and CCT transformation-start times have been incorporated in a mathematical model to predict continuous-cooling transformation kinetics that agree closely with measurements made at three cooling rates.},

@article{noauthor_principle_2014,
  title = {Principle of Minimum Energy},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {The principle of minimum energy is essentially a restatement of the second law of thermodynamics. It states that for a closed system, with constant external parameters and entropy, the internal energy will decrease and approach a minimum value at equilibrium. External parameters generally means the volume, but may include other parameters which are specified externally, such as a constant magnetic field.
In contrast, the second law states that for isolated systems, (and fixed external parameters) the entropy will increase to a maximum value at equilibrium. An isolated system has a fixed total energy and mass. A closed system, on the other hand, is a system which is connected to another system, and may exchange energy, but not mass, with the other system. If, rather than an isolated system, we have a closed system, in which the entropy rather than the energy remains constant, then it follows from the first and second laws of thermodynamics that the energy of that system will drop to a minimum value at equilibrium, transferring its energy to the other system. To restate:
The maximum entropy principle: For a closed system with fixed internal energy (i.e. an isolated system), the entropy is maximized at equilibrium.
The minimum energy principle: For a closed system with fixed entropy, the total energy is minimized at equilibrium.
This should not be confused with the minimum total potential energy principle which states that, at equilibrium, the total potential energy of a system with dissipation will be at a minimum, which is a special case of the maximum entropy principle.
As an example, consider the familiar example of a marble on the edge of a bowl. If we consider the marble and bowl to be an isolated system, then when the marble drops, the potential energy will be converted to the kinetic energy of motion of the marble. Frictional forces will convert this kinetic energy to heat, and at equilibrium, the marble will be at rest at the bottom of the bowl, and the marble and the bowl will be at a slightly higher temperature. The total energy of the marble-bowl system will be unchanged. What was previously the potential energy of the marble, will now reside in the increased heat energy of the marble-bowl system. This will be an application of the maximum entropy principle as set forth in the principle of minimum potential energy, since due to the heating effects, the entropy has increased to the maximum value possible given the fixed energy of the system.
If, on the other hand, the marble is lowered very slowly to the bottom of the bowl, so slowly that no heating effects occur (i.e. reversibly), then the entropy of the marble and bowl will remain constant, and the potential energy of the marble will be transferred as work energy to the apparatus that is lowering the marble. Since the potential energy is now at a minimum with no increase in the energy due to heat of either the marble or the bowl, the total energy of the system is at a minimum. This is an application of the minimum energy principle.},

  abstract = {A review is given on the formation mechanisms and the properties of Si/Ge nanostructures that have been synthesized by self-assembling and self-ordering during heteroepitaxy of \textbackslash{}mbox\{silicon-germanium\} alloys on single-crystal silicon substrates. The properties of electronic subbands in smooth strained Si/SiGe quantum well structures are presented as a basis for characterizing coherent Si/Ge nanostructures with free motion of carriers in a reduced number of dimensions. The low-dimensional band structure of valence band states confined in strained Si/Ge and Si/SiGe nanostructures is analysed by optical and electrical spectroscopy. The nanostructures presented were fabricated by self-assembly induced by elastic strain relaxation without applying any patterning technique. Misfit lattice strain of SiGe material deposited on Si substrates can relax by bunching of atomic surface steps with SiGe agglomeration at the step edges or by nucleation of Ge-rich islands in the Stranski-Krastanow growth mode. The size, density and composition of such Si/Ge nanostructures representing quantum wires and dots, respectively, can be tuned in a wide range by the growth parameters. Local strain fields extending into the Si host influence the nucleation and the lateral arrangement of nanostructures in subsequent layers and can be applied for self-ordering of nanostructures in the vertical as well as the lateral direction. Interband and intra-valence-band photocurrent, absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy as well as C-V and admittance measurements reveal a consistent view of the band structure in Si/Ge quantum dot structures. This is in good agreement with model calculations based on band offsets, deformation potentials and effective electron masses known from earlier studies of Si/SiGe quantum well structures. The effective valence band offsets of hole states within Si/Ge nanostructures reach about 400 meV. Typical quantization energies of about 40 meV due to lateral confinement and Coulomb charging energies up to about 15 meV were observed for holes confined in 20 nm sized Si/Ge dots. Future applications of Si/Ge nanostructures such as photodetectors with improved performance or novel functionality are discussed.},

  abstract = {Magnetism plays a crucial role in the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of ferritic alloys. In fact, magnetism increases the solubility limit of Cr in Fe, inducing an asymmetrical phase diagram. Moreover, the phase transition from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic (F/P) iron alloys modifies to a large extent the system response to different environmental conditions by modification of the alloy diffusion properties. Indeed, experimental tracer diffusion coefficients deviate from an Arrhenius law during the F/P magnetic transition, leading to a large increase in the paramagnetic regime compared to the extrapolated value from the ferromagnetic domain. Furthermore, as the Curie temperature decreases with the Cr concentration, this evolution of the diffusion properties affects the decomposition kinetics in different ways depending on the alloy composition. An atomic diffusion model, with pair interactions that depend on the local composition and on temperature, has been developed to take into account this magnetic transition effect. The interaction model has been implemented in an atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to study the diffusion coefficients and precipitation kinetics of the Fe\textendash{}Cr alloys. This model has been successfully compared to decomposition kinetic experiments for a wide range of concentrations and temperatures.},

Several illustrative examples are used to accomplish this, including protein complexes formed at the oil\textendash{}water interface, ionically crosslinked block copolymer monolayers at oil\textendash{}water interfaces, and block copolymer-based thermoplastic elastomers at the air\textendash{}water interface.

Tin shows a chemical similarity to both neighboring group-14 elements, germanium and lead, and has two possible oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table. It is a silvery, malleable other metal that is not easily oxidized in air, obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite where it occurs as tin dioxide, SnO2.
The first alloy used on a large scale since 3000 BC was bronze, an alloy of tin and copper. After 600 BC, pure metallic tin was produced. Pewter, which is an alloy of 85\textendash{}90\% tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper, antimony and lead, was used for flatware from the Bronze Age until the 20th century. In modern times, tin is used in many alloys, most notably tin/lead soft solders, which are typically 60\% or more tin. Another large application for tin is corrosion-resistant tin plating of steel. Because of its low toxicity, tin-plated metal was used for food packaging as tin cans, which are now made mostly of steel, even though the name is kept in English.},

  title = {Gold},
  copyright = {Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License},
  abstract = {Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, and is solid under standard conditions. The metal therefore occurs often in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides).
Gold's atomic number of 79 makes it one of the higher atomic number elements that occur naturally in the universe. It is thought to have been produced in supernova nucleosynthesis and from the collision of neutron stars and to have been present in the dust from which the Solar System formed. Because the Earth was molten when it was just formed, almost all of the gold present in the early Earth probably sank into the planetary core. Therefore, most of the gold that is present today in the Earth's crust and mantle is thought to have been delivered to Earth later, by asteroid impacts during the late heavy bombardment, about 4 billion years ago.
Gold resists attack by individual acids, but aqua regia (literally "royal water", a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid) can dissolve it. The acid mixture causes the formation of a soluble tetrachloroaurate anion. It is insoluble in nitric acid, which dissolves silver and base metals, a property that has long been used to refine gold and to confirm the presence of gold in metallic objects, giving rise to the term acid test. Gold also dissolves in alkaline solutions of cyanide, which are used in mining and electroplating. Gold dissolves in mercury, forming amalgam alloys, but this is not a chemical reaction.
Gold is a precious metal used for coinage, jewelry, and other arts throughout recorded history. In the past, a gold standard was often implemented as a monetary policy within and between nations, but gold coins ceased to be minted as a circulating currency in the 1930s, and the world gold standard was abandoned for a fiat currency system after 1976. The historical value of gold was rooted in its relative rarity, easy handling and minting, easy smelting and fabrication, resistance to corrosion and other chemical reactions (nobility), and distinctive color.
A total of 183,600 tonnes of gold is in existence above ground, as of 2014. This is equivalent to 9513 m3 of gold. The world consumption of new gold produced is about 50\% in jewelry, 40\% in investments, and 10\% in industry. Gold's high malleability, ductility, resistance to corrosion and most other chemical reactions, and conductivity of electricity have led to its continued use in corrosion resistant electrical connectors in all types of computerized devices (its chief industrial use). Gold is also used in infrared shielding, colored-glass production, gold leafing, and tooth restoration. Certain gold salts are still used as anti-inflammatories in medicine.},

  abstract = {Tungsten, also known as wolfram, is a chemical element with symbol W and atomic number 74. The word tungsten comes from the Swedish language tung sten, which directly translates to heavy stone. Its name in Swedish is volfram, however, in order to distinguish it from scheelite, which in Swedish is alternatively named tungsten.
A hard, rare metal under standard conditions when uncombined, tungsten is found naturally on Earth almost exclusively in chemical compounds. It was identified as a new element in 1781, and first isolated as a metal in 1783. Its important ores include wolframite and scheelite. The free element is remarkable for its robustness, especially the fact that it has the highest melting point of all the elements. Its high density is 19.3 times that of water, comparable to that of uranium and gold, and much higher (about 1.7 times) than that of lead. Polycrystalline tungsten is an intrinsically brittle and hard material, making it difficult to work. However, pure single-crystalline tungsten is more ductile, and can be cut with a hard-steel hacksaw.
Tungsten's many alloys have numerous applications, including incandescent light bulb filaments, X-ray tubes (as both the filament and target), electrodes in TIG welding, superalloys, and radiation shielding. Tungsten's hardness and high density give it military applications in penetrating projectiles. Tungsten compounds are also often used as industrial catalysts.
Tungsten is the only metal from the third transition series that is known to occur in biomolecules, where it is used in a few species of bacteria and archaea. It is the heaviest element known to be used by any living organism except uranium. Tungsten interferes with molybdenum and copper metabolism and is somewhat toxic to animal life.},

The great advantage of this method is that it does not require explicitly solving the constraint equations and using them to eliminate extra variables, which indeed is a convenient approach only with simple constraints that can be parametrized.
The method can be summarized as follows:
isolate any possible singular point of the solution set of the constraining equations,
find all the stationary points of the Lagrange function,
establish which of those stationary points and singular points are global maxima (or minima, in case of minimization problems) of the objective function.},

A review of the modified Wulff (i.e., twinned) construction is presented here, followed by the development of a modified kinetic Wulff model, which, by including kinetic parameters, explains the emergence of commonly observed shapes such as bitetrahedra, truncated bitetrahedra, thin triangular platelets, perfect decahedra, and decahedral rods.},

In terrestrial experiments, strong electromagnetic fields are necessary to compensate the earth's gravity. Their influence on the drop cannot be neglected, and a correction formula is applied to obtain the true surface tension. In microgravity, the positioning forces are negligible. Comparison of the corrected ground-based results with our microgravity data yield excellent agreement.},

  volume = {117},
  abstract = {Measurements of change in length and change in lattice parameter were made at identical temperatures on 99.995\% aluminum in the temperature range 229 to 656\textdegree{}C. Length changes, {$\Delta$}L, were measured on an unconstrained horizontal bar sample using a rigid pair of filar micrometer microscopes. X-ray lattice parameter changes, {$\Delta$}a, were observed using a high-angle, back-reflection, rotating-single-crystal technique. The measurements are compared to earlier work. The relative expansions {$\Delta$}LL and {$\Delta$}aa were equal within about 1:105 from 229 to 415\textdegree{}C. At higher temperatures additional atomic sites were found to be generated: the difference between the two expansions could be represented by 3({$\Delta$}LL-{$\Delta$}aa)=exp(2.4)exp(-0.76 ev/kT). At the melting point (660\textdegree{}C) the equilibrium concentration of additional sites is 3({$\Delta$}LL-{$\Delta$}aa)=9.4\texttimes{}10-4. This result is independent of the detailed nature of the defects, for example, the lattice relaxation or degree of association. The nature of the defects is considered and it is concluded that they are predominantly lattice vacancies; it is estimated that the divacancy contribution at the melting point may well be less than about 15\%, corresponding to a divacancy binding energy {$\leqslant$} 0.25 ev. The observed formation energy agrees with the values obtained by quenching techniques and by interpretation of the high-temperature electrical resistivity of identical material by Simmons and Balluffi. The present work is the first direct measurement of formation entropy; the value is near that expected from theoretical considerations. The contribution of the thermally generated defects to other physical properties at high temperatures is considered briefly.},

Calculations are out to estimate the intrinsic entropies associated with such lattice defects as interstitialcies and vacancies, and with the activated complexes of vacancy and ring diffusion. The present application is to fcc metals and a very simplified force model representing only the closed-shell, ion-core repulsions of copper has been used. The problem consists in evaluating the change of lattice vibrations with the introduction of each defect. The method is in a first approximation to consider vibrations localized around the defect as separate from elastic vibrations at appreciable distance from the defect. Only in the region far from the defect is the entropy contribution always positive. The surface condition of zero pressure introduces a term which reduces the effect of the "localized" vibrations. In general the intrinsic entropy is less positive for those configurations where there is crowding of the atoms than for those configurations where the atoms have greater free volume.},

  abstract = {Despite the increasing use of computers, the basic need for mathematical tables continues. Tables serve a vital role in preliminary surveys of problems before programming for machine operation, and they are indispensable to thousands of engineers and scientists without access to machines. Because of automatic computers, however, and because of recent scientific advances, a greater variety of functions and a higher accuracy of tabulation than have been available until now are required.In 1954, a conference on mathematical tables, sponsored by M.I.T. and the National Science Foundation, met to discuss a modernization and extension of Jahnke and Emde's classical tables of functions. This volume, published 10 years later by the U.S. Department of Commerce, is the result. Designed to include a maximum of information and to meet the needs of scientists in all fields, it is a monumental piece of work, a comprehensive and self-contained summary of the mathematical functions that arise in physical and engineering problems.The book contains 29 sets of tables, some to as high as 20 places: mathematical constants; physical constants and conversion factors (6 tables); exponential integral and related functions (7); error function and Fresnel integrals (12); Bessel functions of integer (12) and fractional (13) order; integrals of Bessel functions (2); Struve and related functions (2); confluent hypergeometric functions (2); Coulomb wave functions (2); hypergeometric functions; Jacobian elliptic and theta functions (2); elliptic integrals \{9); Weierstrass elliptic and related functions; parabolic cylinder functions \{3); Mathieu functions (2); spheroidal wave functions (5); orthogonal polynomials (13); combinatorial analysis (9); numerical interpolation, differentiation and integration (11); probability functions (ll); scales of notation \{6); miscellaneous functions \{9); Laplace transforms (2); and others.Each of these sections is prefaced by a list of related formulas and graphs: differential equations, series expansions, special functions, and other basic relations. These constitute an unusually valuable reference work in themselves. The prefatory material also includes an explanation of the numerical methods involved in using the tables that follow and a bibliography. Numerical examples illustrate the use of each table and explain the computation of function values which lie outside its range, while the editors' introduction describes higher-order interpolation procedures. Well over 100 figures illustrate the text.In all, this is one of the most ambitious and useful books of its type ever published, an essential aid in all scientific and engineering research, problem solving, experimentation and field work.

  abstract = {The thermodynamic square (also known as the thermodynamic wheel, Guggenheim scheme or Born square) is a mnemonic diagram attributed to Max Born and used to help determine thermodynamic relations. Born presented the thermodynamic square in a 1929 lecture. The symmetry of thermodynamics appears in a paper by F.O. Koenig. The corners represent common conjugate variables while the sides represent thermodynamic potentials. The placement and relation among the variables serves as a key to recall the relations they constitute.
A mnemonic used by students to remember the Maxwell relations (in thermodynamics) is "Good Physicists Have Studied Under Very Fine Teachers", which helps them remember the order of the variables in the square, in clockwise direction. Another mnemonic used here is "Valid Facts and Theoretical Understanding Generate Solutions to Hard Problems", which gives the letter in the normal left-to-right writing direction. Both times A has to be identified with F, another common symbol for Helmholtz' Free Energy. To prevent the need for this switch the following mnemonic is also widely used:"Good Physicists Have Studied Under Very Ambitious Teachers". One other useful variation of the mnemonic when the symbol E is used for internal energy instead of U is the following: "Some Hard Problems Go To Finish Very Easy".},

  abstract = {In thermodynamics, the internal energy of a system is expressed in terms of pairs of conjugate variables such as temperature and entropy or pressure and volume. In fact, all thermodynamic potentials are expressed in terms of conjugate pairs. The product of two quantities that are conjugate has units of energy or sometimes power.
For a mechanical system, a small increment of energy is the product of a force times a small displacement. A similar situation exists in thermodynamics. An increment in the energy of a thermodynamic system can be expressed as the sum of the products of certain generalized "forces" that, when unbalanced, cause certain generalized "displacements", and the product of the two is the energy transferred as a result. These forces and their associated displacements are called conjugate variables. The thermodynamic force is always an intensive variable and the displacement is always an extensive variable, yielding an extensive energy transfer. The intensive (force) variable is the derivative of the internal energy with respect to the extensive (displacement) variable, while all other extensive variables are held constant.
The thermodynamic square can be used as a tool to recall and derive some of the thermodynamic potentials based on conjugate variables.
In the above description, the product of two conjugate variables yields an energy. In other words, the conjugate pairs are conjugate with respect to energy. In general, conjugate pairs can be defined with respect to any thermodynamic state function. Conjugate pairs with respect to entropy are often used, in which the product of the conjugate pairs yields an entropy. Such conjugate pairs are particularly useful in the analysis of irreversible processes, as exemplified in the derivation of the Onsager reciprocal relations. The present article is concerned only with energy-conjugate variables.},

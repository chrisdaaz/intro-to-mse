# Preface

This text introduces the core topics and foundational concepts of Materials Science and Engineering. It is structured within the framework of the Materials Science Paradigm @fig:MSEParadigm, which focuses in the causal relationship between materials processing, structural, properties, and performance (). We cover introductory materials processing, structure, properties, and performance with particular emphasis on the relationship between structure and properties. We focus on conventional materials classes: metals, ceramics, and polymers - and discuss their various properties - such as mechanical, electronic, thermal, optical, magnetic, and electrochemical. Broader themes that arise are how materialsâ€™ performance influences technological development, the economy, the environment, and society. This text is a pilot version intended to leverage computational tools to assist students in connecting conceptual understanding of materials science-relevant phenomenon with their mathematical models.
